Info: ed_synth_emif_fm_0.emif_fm_0: SPD Bytes must be set for RDIMM/LRDIMM and are unique to each memory module. Please check with the SPD provider to ensure correct SPD data.
Info: ed_synth_emif_fm_0.emif_fm_0.arch: Agilex EMIF IP requires EMIF Calibration IP to source its calbus clock and calbus conduit.
Info: ed_synth_emif_fm_0.emif_fm_0.arch: PHY and controller running at 2x the frequency of user logic for improved efficiency.
Info: ed_synth_emif_fm_0.emif_fm_0.arch: Placement of address/command pins must follow "DDR4 Scheme 1A: Component and DIMM (with A17)".
Info: ed_synth_emif_fm_0.emif_fm_0.arch: Interface estimated to require 2 I/O Bank(s) and 4 I/O PLL(s). This is only an estimation. Final usage depends on user pin location assignments and/or fitter behavior.
Info: ed_synth_emif_fm_0.emif_fm_0.arch: Valid memory frequencies for the current PLL reference clock of 33.333 MHz and user clock rate, in MHz: 1599.98, 1466.65, 1333.32, 1199.99, 1066.66, 933.32, 799.99, 666.66
Info: ed_synth_emif_fm_0.emif_fm_0.arch: For additional documentation about the interface, consult the *_readme.txt file after generation.
